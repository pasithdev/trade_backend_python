```pinescript
strategy("Intelligent Crypto Scalper v1.0", 
     overlay=true,                              // Display on price chart
     pyramiding=0,                              // No position pyramiding
     initial_capital=10000,                     // $10,000 starting capital
     default_qty_type=strategy.percent_of_equity,  // Position sizing method
     default_qty_value=100,                     // 100% of calculated size
     commission_type=strategy.commission.percent,  // Commission as percentage
     commission_value=0.075,                    // 0.075% per trade (Binance fees)
     slippage=2,                                // 2 ticks slippage
     margin_long=100,                           // 100% margin for long
     margin_short=100)                          // 100% margin for short

### TradingView Strategy Tester Configuration

When testing on TradingView, use these settings:

#### Chart Settings
```
Symbol: BTC/USDT (or ETH/USDT, other major pairs)
Timeframe: 5 minutes
Data Range: Minimum 6 months (recommended 12+ months)
Session: 24/7 (crypto markets)
```

#### Strategy Tester Settings
```
Order Size: Percentage of equity (already configured in code)
Initial Capital: $10,000 (already configured in code)

Slippage: 2 ticks (already configured in code)
Verify Price for Limit Orders: Enabled
Recalculate After Order Filled: Enabled (IMPORTANT)

```

#### Properties Tab Settings
```
✅ Recalculate After Order Filled: ON
   - Critical for accurate partial exit simulation
   - Ensures TP1/TP2 logic executes correctly
   
✅ Recalculate On Every Tick: OFF

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a professional-grade Pine Script v5 strategy for TradingView that implements intelligent scalping logic for cryptocurrency markets on the 5-minute timeframe. The strategy will use advanced market structure analysis, volatility filtering, and adaptive risk management to execute high-frequency trades while maintaining profitability through smart entry selection and dynamic profit protection mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Market Analysis and Entry Filtering

**User Story:** As a crypto scalper, I want the strategy to identify only high-probability trading setups by analyzing micro-trends and volatility, so that I avoid losing trades in choppy or sideways markets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the market is in a sideways or choppy condition THEN the strategy SHALL NOT generate entry signals
2. WHEN volatility exceeds a configurable threshold (using ATR or Kaufman Efficiency Ratio) THEN the strategy SHALL mark the market as tradeable
3. WHEN a short-term breakout occurs above recent swing high or below recent swing low THEN the strategy SHALL identify it as a potential entry opportunity
4. WHEN a liquidity sweep is detected (price briefly breaks a level then reverses) THEN the strategy SHALL flag it as a high-probability entry zone
5. IF the market structure shows clear micro-trend formation THEN the strategy SHALL allow entry signal generation

### Requirement 2: Smart Entry Signal Generation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want entries to be confirmed by multiple momentum indicators, so that I only enter trades with strong directional bias and avoid false breakouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a breakout or liquidity sweep occurs AND at least one momentum filter confirms THEN the strategy SHALL generate an entry signal
2. IF volume spike is detected (volume > moving average of volume) THEN the strategy SHALL count it as momentum confirmation
3. IF fast moving average slope exceeds threshold THEN the strategy SHALL count it as momentum confirmation
4. IF candle body size is significantly larger than recent average THEN the strategy SHALL count it as momentum confirmation
5. WHEN entry conditions are met for long direction THEN the strategy SHALL generate a long entry signal
6. WHEN entry conditions are met for short direction THEN the strategy SHALL generate a short entry signal
7. IF multiple entries occur within a cooldown period THEN the strategy SHALL reject subsequent entries to prevent overtrading

### Requirement 3: Adaptive Stop Loss Management

**User Story:** As a risk-conscious trader, I want stop losses to automatically adjust based on current market volatility, so that I'm protected from adverse moves while avoiding premature exits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a long position is entered THEN the strategy SHALL place a stop loss below entry based on ATR multiplier or last swing low
2. WHEN a short position is entered THEN the strategy SHALL place a stop loss above entry based on ATR multiplier or last swing high
3. IF market volatility increases THEN the strategy SHALL widen stop loss distance accordingly
4. IF market volatility decreases THEN the strategy SHALL tighten stop loss distance accordingly
5. WHEN stop loss is calculated THEN the strategy SHALL ensure it respects minimum and maximum distance parameters

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Take Profit and Partial Exit System

**User Story:** As a scalper, I want to secure partial profits quickly while letting winners run with a trailing stop, so that every trade has the best chance of closing in net profit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a position reaches the first take profit target (configurable 0.5%-1%) THEN the strategy SHALL close a partial position (configurable percentage, e.g., 50%)
2. WHEN partial profit is taken THEN the strategy SHALL activate a trailing stop for the remaining position
3. IF the trailing stop is triggered THEN the strategy SHALL close the remaining position
4. WHEN calculating take profit levels THEN the strategy SHALL adjust targets based on current ATR to match market volatility
5. IF price moves favorably beyond first target THEN the trailing stop SHALL lock in incremental profits
6. WHEN a position is closed THEN the strategy SHALL ensure the net result accounts for both partial and full exits

### Requirement 5: Frequency Control and Overtrading Prevention

**User Story:** As a scalper, I want the strategy to execute multiple trades per hour when conditions are favorable, but prevent overtrading during choppy periods, so that I maximize opportunities without excessive risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market conditions are favorable THEN the strategy SHALL allow multiple entry signals per hour
2. WHEN a trade is entered THEN the strategy SHALL start a cooldown timer (configurable in minutes)
3. IF a new signal occurs during cooldown period THEN the strategy SHALL reject the entry
4. WHEN cooldown period expires AND conditions are met THEN the strategy SHALL allow new entries
5. IF the strategy detects consecutive losing trades (configurable threshold) THEN the strategy SHALL extend cooldown period

### Requirement 6: Position Sizing and Risk Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want position sizes to be calculated based on my account equity and risk tolerance, so that I maintain consistent risk across all trades regardless of stop loss distance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating position size THEN the strategy SHALL use configurable percentage of equity at risk (e.g., 1-2%)
2. WHEN stop loss distance is determined THEN the strategy SHALL calculate position size such that maximum loss equals risk percentage
3. IF calculated position size exceeds maximum allowed THEN the strategy SHALL cap it at the maximum
4. IF calculated position size is below minimum allowed THEN the strategy SHALL use the minimum or skip the trade
5. WHEN position size is calculated THEN the strategy SHALL account for leverage settings if applicable

### Requirement 7: Visual Feedback and Performance Tracking

**User Story:** As a trader analyzing the strategy, I want clear visual indicators on the chart and comprehensive performance statistics, so that I can understand trade decisions and evaluate strategy effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a long entry occurs THEN the strategy SHALL plot a green label with "LONG" text at entry point
2. WHEN a short entry occurs THEN the strategy SHALL plot a red label with "SHORT" text at entry point
3. WHEN a position is closed THEN the strategy SHALL plot an exit marker showing exit price
4. WHEN stop loss and take profit levels are set THEN the strategy SHALL draw horizontal lines showing these levels
5. WHEN market is in filtered-out choppy condition THEN the strategy SHALL display gray background shading
6. WHEN viewing Strategy Tester results THEN the strategy SHALL display win rate, net profit, profit factor, and total trades
7. IF a trade is rejected due to filters THEN the strategy SHALL optionally plot a small marker indicating filtered signal

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a trader with specific preferences, I want to customize all key parameters of the strategy, so that I can adapt it to different market conditions and risk profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure ATR period and multiplier
2. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure swing lookback period for structure analysis
3. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure take profit percentage and partial exit percentage
4. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure cooldown period in minutes
5. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure risk percentage per trade
6. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to enable/disable individual momentum filters
7. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure volume spike threshold
8. WHEN accessing strategy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to configure minimum volatility threshold for trading

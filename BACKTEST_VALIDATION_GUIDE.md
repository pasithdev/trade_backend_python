## Validation Checklist

### 1. Trade Generation Validation ✅

**Expected Behavior:**
- Strategy should generate trades (check "List of Trades" tab)
- Trades should appear on chart as green/red triangles
- Both long and short trades should be present (if market conditions allow)

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Check "List of Trades" tab shows trades
2. [ ] Verify trades appear on chart with entry markers
3. [ ] Confirm trade frequency is reasonable (8-15 per day target)
4. [ ] Check that trades occur during volatile periods (not choppy zones)

**If No Trades Generated:**
- Market may be too choppy (check gray background shading)
- Filters may be too strict (try reducing min_confirmations)
- Volatility threshold may be too high (try reducing to 0.8)

### 2. Stop Loss/Take Profit Logic Validation ✅

**Expected Behavior:**
- Red lines should appear for stop losses
- Green dashed lines for TP1
- Blue dashed lines for TP2 (after TP1 hit)
- Purple crosses for trailing stops (after TP2 hit)

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Verify stop loss lines appear on active trades
2. [ ] Confirm TP1 lines display correctly
3. [ ] Check that TP2 lines appear after TP1 is hit
4. [ ] Verify trailing stops activate after TP2
5. [ ] Confirm stop loss moves to breakeven after TP1

**Check Trade Details:**
- Click on a trade in "List of Trades"
- Verify exit reason (TP1, TP2, Trail, SL, 10-Bar, etc.)
- Confirm partial exits are working (multiple exits per entry)

### 3. Tiered Entry System Validation ✅

**Expected Behavior:**
- Entry labels should show tier information (if enabled)
- Different tiers should have different position sizes
- Tier 1 should be most frequent in trending markets
- Tier 3 should appear during high volume spikes

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Check entry labels show "L-T1", "L-T2", "L-T3" (or S-T1, etc.)
2. [ ] Verify position sizes vary by tier (check trade list)
3. [ ] Confirm Tier 1 trades have largest position sizes
4. [ ] Verify Tier 3 trades have smallest position sizes

**Check Statistics Table:**
- Look at tier breakdown in performance table
- Verify all three tiers are generating trades
- Check win rates per tier

### 4. Performance Metrics Validation ✅

**Expected Metrics (Target Ranges):**
```
Win Rate: 55-65%
Profit Factor: 2.0-2.5+
Max Drawdown: < 12%
Average Trades Per Day: 8-15
Average Trade Duration: 5-30 minutes (1-6 bars)
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Check win rate is above 55%
2. [ ] Verify profit factor is above 2.0
3. [ ] Confirm max drawdown is below 12%
4. [ ] Count average trades per day
5. [ ] Check average bars in trade (should be 1-6)

**If Metrics Are Outside Target Ranges:**
- Win rate too low: Increase min_confirmations or reduce enabled tiers
- Profit factor too low: Adjust TP ratios or tighten stop losses
- Drawdown too high: Reduce risk_per_trade_pct or position size multipliers
- Too many trades: Increase cooldown periods or reduce hourly limits
- Too few trades: Reduce cooldown, increase hourly limits, or enable more tiers

### 5. Frequency Control Validation ✅

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cooldown periods should prevent overtrading
- Hourly limits should cap trades per hour
- Win streak bonus should activate after 3+ wins
- Recovery mode should activate after 3 consecutive losses

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Check trades are spaced appropriately (not every bar)
2. [ ] Verify no more than 6-8 trades per hour
3. [ ] Look for clusters of trades after wins (win streak bonus)
4. [ ] Check for reduced trading after losses (recovery mode)

**Check Statistics Table:**
- Verify "Streak" shows consecutive wins/losses
- Check "Bonus" status shows when active
- Confirm "Trades/Hour" respects limits

### 6. Visualization Validation ✅

**Expected Visual Elements:**
- Entry markers (green triangles up, red triangles down)
- Exit markers (small circles, green for wins, red for losses)
- Stop loss lines (red solid)
- Take profit lines (green/blue dashed)
- Trailing stops (purple crosses)
- Choppy market zones (gray background)
- Swing points (small orange triangles)
- Performance statistics table (top right)

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Verify all entry markers are visible
2. [ ] Check exit markers show profit/loss color coding
3. [ ] Confirm SL/TP lines display during active trades
4. [ ] Verify choppy zones are shaded gray
5. [ ] Check swing points are marked
6. [ ] Confirm statistics table displays in top right corner

**If Visualizations Missing:**
- Check visualization toggles in inputs (show_sl_tp_lines, etc.)
- Ensure chart is not too zoomed out (markers may be too small)
- Verify overlay=true in strategy declaration

### 7. Breakeven Management Validation ✅

**Expected Behavior:**
- Stop loss should move to breakeven + 0.1% after TP1 hits
- 5-bar rule: Move to breakeven if no TP1 after 5 bars
- 10-bar rule: Close 50% if no TP1 after 10 bars

**Validation Steps:**
1. [ ] Find a trade that hit TP1
2. [ ] Verify stop loss moved to entry price (or slightly above/below)
3. [ ] Check that trade became profitable after TP1
4. [ ] Look for trades closed by "10-Bar" rule
5. [ ] Verify no trades turned into losses after hitting TP1

**Check Trade List:**
- Filter for trades with "TP1" exit reason
- Verify final P&L is positive for all TP1 exits
- Check for "10-Bar" exits (time-based protection)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: No Trades Generated

**Possible Causes:**
- Market too choppy (low volatility)
- Filters too strict
- Volatility threshold too high

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `volatility_threshold` to 0.8
2. Reduce `min_confirmations_tier1` to 2
3. Enable all three tiers
4. Try different symbol (ETH/USDT, etc.)
5. Try different date range (more volatile period)

### Issue 2: Too Many Losing Trades

**Possible Causes:**
- Stop losses too tight
- Take profits too far
- Entering in choppy markets

**Solutions:**
1. Increase `atr_multiplier_sl` to 1.5
2. Reduce `tp1_rr_ratio` to 0.5 (quicker profits)
3. Increase `min_confirmations_tier1` to 4
4. Disable Tier 2 and Tier 3 temporarily
5. Increase `volatility_threshold` to 1.2

### Issue 3: Profit Factor Too Low

**Possible Causes:**
- Commission/slippage too high
- Stop losses too wide
- Not enough partial profit-taking

**Solutions:**
1. Verify commission is 0.075% (not higher)
2. Reduce `atr_multiplier_sl` to 1.0
3. Increase `partial_close_tp1_pct` to 50%
4. Enable time-based profit locks
5. Reduce `tp2_rr_ratio` for quicker exits

### Issue 4: Max Drawdown Too High

**Possible Causes:**
- Position sizes too large
- Risk per trade too high
- Consecutive losses not managed

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `risk_per_trade_pct` to 0.5%
2. Reduce position size multipliers (Tier 2 to 60%, Tier 3 to 30%)
3. Increase `cooldown_after_loss` to 3 bars
4. Reduce `max_trades_hour_normal` to 4
5. Enable recovery mode (already automatic)

### Issue 5: Partial Exits Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
- "Recalculate After Order Filled" disabled
- TP levels not being reached
- Code error in partial exit logic

**Solutions:**
1. **CRITICAL**: Enable "Recalculate After Order Filled" in Properties
2. Check TP1/TP2 lines are displaying on chart
3. Verify trades are reaching TP levels (check trade list)
4. Review exit reasons in trade list

### Issue 6: Unrealistic Performance

**Possible Causes:**
- Look-ahead bias
- Incorrect commission/slippage
- "Recalculate On Every Tick" enabled

**Solutions:**
1. Disable "Recalculate On Every Tick"
2. Enable "Process Orders On Close"
3. Verify commission is 0.075%
4. Verify slippage is 2 ticks
5. Check that orders execute at bar close (not intra-bar)

- Enable time-based profit locks
```

### For More Trades
```
- Reduce cooldown_after_win (0 → 0)
- Reduce cooldown_after_loss (2 → 1)
